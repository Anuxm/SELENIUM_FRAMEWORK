1]UnboundLocalError: local variable 'HomePage' referenced before assignment
# Suppose you have defined the class as before
class HomePage:
    # Class code...

# And you are trying to create an instance like this
def some_function():
    HomePage = "some value"  # This creates a variable named HomePage in the function scope
    # Now if you try to create an instance of the class, it will raise the UnboundLocalError
    home_page = HomePage(driver)  # UnboundLocalError: local variable 'HomePage' referenced before assignment
