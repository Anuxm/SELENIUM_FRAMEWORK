webdriver is the class present in the selenium pakage
to invoke chrome u have call driver
drom selenium we cant directly call chrome brower or firebox browser
browser driver-- provide proxy driver using that we can invoke actual browser
we cannt directly inove chrome browser using python we need to have intermediate driver
 driver object holds the chromw browser
 whaterver u perform on driver object that will be directly applied on the chrome browser
 #driver has a full control on browser which got invoked

 driver.get=hit the url in the  browser--open chrome and hit whaterver the url i have passed
 driver.title=what is present on the browser lel (in the url there is one name(title))
 (properties brakets wont come,it gets the title u want to see then print)
 driver.current_url=it will get the url what is present at that moment on the browser
 (before testing it we have to make sure that we have landed on correct url)

 #text--will grab the element which is present in that element
#---browser top level--tool bar elements-----#
 #maximize the brower window
 driver.maximize_window()

 #from this website i want to go other url
 #minimize the browser
 driver.minimize_window()
 #back symbol u see in browser<--- to navigate to previosurl
 driver.back()
 driver.minimize_window()
 driver.back()
 driver.refresh()
 driver.forward()
#locators--id,name,css selector,xpath,link texxt
using these locators u can identify the elements on the page
id,name,classname=if the developer defines this propertieswe can use it
we can construct xpath and css selctor=any elements on the page

#finding elements of webpage using the xpath
#syntax="//tagname[@attribute="value"]"
# tagname =input,form etc first element after<input  //form means it will select all the form

#we can traverse from parent to child through tags //form/div[1]/input

#finding elements of webpage using the css selector (to create custom css)
#[using [],#id,.classname]
#syntax="tagname[attribute="value"]"
# #idvalue and .classname ex= ".alert-success"
# #exampleInputPassword1

#sometimes mutiple elements will match in xpath by default selenium starts from top left whaterver it first gets it try to enter i want to enter in last box we can try different class name or put in brakets give index[3]
# (//tagname[@attribute='value'])[index]
#assert-will tell pass or fail based upon our validation
